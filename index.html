        <h1>Accessibility Specialist Exercise</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Accessibility Team's interview exercise. The goal of this exercise is to give us an
            idea of where you stand, in regards to your awareness of accessibility standards while assessing or remediating a website. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways to complete this exercise:
        </p>    
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Your objective is to evaluate how well the website linked below fits WCAG accessibility standards. Write up a report on 5 accessibility issues in this site, 
                in the format of your choice. There are many more than 5 issues - please limit your report to only 5. Be prepared to present your findings during the next round of the interview.</li>
            <li><strong>Remediation:</strong> Your objective is to resolve issues in the website linked below to meet WCAG accessibility standards. Similar to the assessment, please limit your efforts to 3 - 5 issues 
                and be prepared to discuss your approach in the next round of the interview. You may fork the code on Github, or use another method of your choice that demonstrates your ability to develop
                accessible code.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            After completing the exercise, please send your assessment report or your remediated code (as files or a link to a repository) for review. During the next interview, be prepared to walk through 
        your work and describe your workflow and approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal is not for you to spend hours upon hours trying to find absolutely everything wrong with the site. 5 specific findings or fixes are all that is needed. Please choose examples that demonstrate your skill with either assessment or
            remediation.
